# PA1: Particle System
This project is based on the OpenFrameworks Particle example.
 This repository is part of a Programming Assignment for the Advanced Programming Course.
 The purpose of this project is to help the student create practical programming skills by implementing
 changes to the base code that require strong understanding of the concepts discussed in class.
## Setup
1. Clone this project inside an OpenFrameworks installation's "apps/myApps/" directory
2. Run the command "make" in the terminal or the "Build" Task in VSCode.

## Submitting Assignment
To submit this assignment, create a Release with the branch that holds all the changes you have added. If no Release is made,
the last commit to the master branch will be graded.

Don't forget that you must also fill out an evaluation form in Moodle to consider the project submitted.

## Grading
You will only be graded for specs that were completed.

Any project that doesn't compile will receive a 0.

If a partner has no commits in the repositories, he will receive a 0.

## Student Notes
We cleaned the display so it looks cleaner, and added a menu button with all the commands inside so the display can be as clean as possible.
